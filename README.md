# TODO

# DONE

- [X] __1.__ Display a list of people from the data file showing first name, last name, email, gender
- [X] __2.__ Allow the user to filter the list by name and email
- [X] __3.__ Allow filtering by gender
- [X] __4.__ Allow the user to sort the list as they wish
- [X] __5.__ Add a link to a detail page showing the personâ€™s info and a list of their friends (including picture)
- [ ] __6.__ Provide suggestions for auto-complete in the name/email filter

## NOTE

__6.__ The page filters on key-up so auto-complete feels like an anti-pattern.
